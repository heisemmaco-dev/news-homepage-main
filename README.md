### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
<a href="https://heisemmaco-dev.github.io/news-homepage-main/">Live Site</a>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS with CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- javascript

### What I learned

In this project, I have enhanced my understanding of structuring web pages using CSS Grid. I thoroughly enjoyed tackling this challenge as it presented a slightly higher level of difficulty compared to my previous endeavors and also notice that i wrote less line of javascript in this project on the order once i do, qudos to me. 

```html
<aside>

  <article>
    <h1>this is the first time i am using the aside tag for a challenge</h1>
  </article>

</aside>
```
what i enjoyed most using nesting with SCSS
```scss

        &[type=number]::-webkit-inner-spin-button,&[type=number]::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
            -webkit-appearance: none;
        }
```
```js
// add event listener to the button so it will toggle

menuButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    header.classList.toggle('showHiddenItem')
})

```

### Continued development

I aim to deepen my comprehension of utilizing JavaScript for DOM manipulation, refining my grasp of JavaScript syntax to enhance the appearance and functionality of a webpage's frontend.
